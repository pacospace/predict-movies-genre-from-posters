Predict movies genre from posters images
=========================================

Goal
----

The aim is to predict the genre of a movie using just its poster image. It is a multi-label image classification problem: A movie can belong to more than one genre. It doesnâ€™t just have to belong to one category, like action or comedy. The movie can be a combination of two or more genres.

Dataset
-------

The dataset for Movie Genre Classification based on Poster Images with Deep Neural Networks is available [here](https://www.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~wtchu/projects/MoviePoster/index.html).

The dataset in zip files contains the poster images of several multi-genre movies. It is in a structured format, i.e. a folder containing the images and a .csv file for true labels.
